- The "regular" docker files use an Ubuntu base image, since many users
  are familiar with Ubuntu and it provides a reasonable small size.

  - openfoam-run.Dockerfile
  - openfoam-dev.Dockerfile
  - openfoam-default.Dockerfile

- Example docker files for RPM-based distributions openSUSE, Fedora
  and RockyLinux.

  - openfoam-run_fedora.Dockerfile
  - openfoam-run_leap.Dockerfile
  - openfoam-run_rocky.Dockerfile

  It is straightforward to adopt these for other requirements.
  For example, using '-devel' or '-default' packages instead.

- Special-purpose docker files (with Ubuntu base image)

  - build_ubuntu.Dockerfile
  - dpkg-tools_ubuntu.Dockerfile

- Other special-purpose docker files

  - build_leap.Dockerfile
  - build_ubifake.Dockerfile
  - deploy_ubi.Dockerfile

The build container currently uses the /openfoam/chroot entrypoint
for user rights. See comments within that file.
