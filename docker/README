- The "regular" docker files use an Ubuntu base image, since may users
  are familiar with Ubuntu and it provides a reasonable small size.

  - openfoam-run.Dockerfile
  - openfoam-dev.Dockerfile
  - openfoam-default.Dockerfile

- Example docker files for RPM-based distributions openSUSE, Fedora
  and RockyLinux.

  - openfoam-run.fedora-Dockerfile
  - openfoam-run.leap-Dockerfile
  - openfoam-run.rocky-Dockerfile

  It should be fairly straightforward to adopt these for other
  requirements. For example, using '-devel' or '-default' packages
  instead.
